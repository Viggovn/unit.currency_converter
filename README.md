# Unit & Currency Converter

A simple unit and currency converter built with **PySide6**.

This project was mainly created as an exercise to learn PySide6 and Qt stylesheets, so the functionality is intentionally limited and not fully fleshed out.

## Features
- Unit conversion
- Currency conversion using an external API

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Viggovn/unit.currency_converter
2. Create a .env file in the project root.
3. Add your API key to the .env file: api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"

## API
The currency converter is built specifically for the ExchangeRate API:
https://www.exchangerate-api.com

Other APIs are not supported.
The free tier of this API is sufficient for this project.

## Notes
1. This project is for learning purposes.
2. Expect rough edges and limited error handling.
